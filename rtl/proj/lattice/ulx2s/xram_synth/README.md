# Project with full featured use of glue_xram and synth

This project makes Polyphonic synth with glue_xram - early support.

Use of glue_xram which contains external SRAM driver
and all features we were able to pack together.

On ULX2S it is recommended to enable all medium size
features like timer, gpio,  but only one big size 
feature like VGA or PID but not both at the same time.
