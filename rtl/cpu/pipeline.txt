Pipeline stages:

IF - instruction fetch
ID - instruction decode
EX - execute
MEM - memory acces
WB - register writeback



MEM stage stall causes:

- write not acknowledged from RAM
- data not ready from RAM
- must shift data received from RAM
- must shift data to be sent to RAM


EX stage stall causes:

- MEM stage stall
- branch in EX, but next instruction not yet in ID


ID stage stall causes:

- EX stage stall
- load-use hazard: operand target of LD in EX stage
	- must insert bubble in EX
