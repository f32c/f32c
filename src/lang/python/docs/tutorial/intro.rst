Introduction to the pyboard
===========================

To get the most out of your pyboard, there are a few basic things to
understand about how it works.

Caring for your pyboard
-----------------------

Because the pyboard does not have a housing it needs a bit of care:

  - Be gentle when plugging/unplugging the USB cable.  Whilst the USB connector
    is soldered through the board and is relatively strong, if it breaks off
    it can be very difficult to fix.

  - Static electricity can shock the components on the pyboard and destroy them.
    If you experience a lot of static electricity in your area (eg dry and cold
    climates), take extra care not to shock the pyboard.  If your pyboard came
    in a black plastic box, then this box is the best way to store and carry the
    pyboard as it is an anti-static box (it is made of a conductive plastic, with
    conductive foam inside).

As long as you take care of the hardware, you should be okay.  It's almost
impossible to break the software on the pyboard, so feel free to play around
with writing code as much as you like.  If the filesystem gets corrupt, see
below on how to reset it.  In the worst case you might need to reflash the
Micro Python software, but that can be done over USB.

Layout of the pyboard
---------------------

The micro USB connector is on the top right, the micro SD card slot on
the top left of the board.  There are 4 LEDs between the SD slot and
USB connector.  The colours are: red on the bottom, then green, orange,
and blue on the top.  There are 2 switches: the right one is the reset
switch, the left is the user switch.

Plugging in and powering on
---------------------------

The pyboard can be powered via USB.  Connect it to your PC via a micro USB
cable.  There is only one way that the cable will fit.  Once connected,
the green LED on the board should flash quickly.

Powering by an external power source
------------------------------------

The pyboard can be powered by a battery or other external power source.

**Be sure to connect the positive lead of the power supply to VIN, and
ground to GND.  There is no polarity protection on the pyboard so you
must be careful when connecting anything to VIN.**

**The input voltage must be between 3.6V and 10V.**
